    <h2>Compiling SWC files</h2>
    <p>In case you purchased developer license with component sources, and made some changes, you'll need to compile your own SWC file. Here are a step-by-step instructions on how to do this.</p>
    <ol>
  <li>create new Flex project, name it "amChartsSources"</li>
  <li>copy contents of the Source/FB3 or Source/FB4 (depending on FB version you are using) folder from the amCharts flex components zip file to the src folder of this project</li>
  <li>create new flex library project and name it amCharts</li>
  <li>right-click on the project name in the Flex Navigator panel and select "Properties"</li>
  <li>select "Flex library build path -> Source path", click "Add folder" button and browse to the amChartsSources/src folder, click OK.</li>
  <li>click "Browse" button near "Main source folder" and select [source path] src folder, click OK.</li>
  <li>click "Classes" at the top, expand the directory tree, check checkbox near "com" folder so that all the files inside would also be selected. Then expand it deeper and deselect "Version" file and "styles" folder.</li>
  <li>click "Assets" at the top, expand the directory tree and check "design.mxml" and "manifest.xml" files</li>
  <li>click "Flex Library compiler" on the left</li> 
  <li>in the Namespace url enter http://www.amcharts.com/com_internal</li>
  <li>click "browse" near manifest file and select manifest.xml</li></ol>
  If you have set that your projects are build automatically, the compiled swc must now be in amCharts/bin folder.

<b>Version 7.2.0 Build 006<br>
15 October 2012<br></b>
<h5 align="center"><i>EnergyPlus is a trademark of the US Department of Energy.</i></h5>
<hr>
<h2>EnergyPlus</h2>
<p><b>What it is, What it is not</b></p>
<p>EnergyPlus is a simulation program designed for modeling buildings with all their associated heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows. EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulation
engine without a 'user friendly' graphical interface . . . EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files. Private sector interface are under development (more than 5 private sector companies
have indicated that they intend to develop EnergyPlus interfaces.) Because public funds (U.S. Department of Energy, primarily) were used to develop EnergyPlus, we chose to develop the engine and not
try "to be all things to all users". Developing good user interfaces takes many resources, specific attention to problem domains, and backing from specific user communities. The team feels that those
interests are better served through private considerations where domain specific funding may help quantify the requirements.</p>
<p>Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor and EP-Launch. Third-party tools for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus
input files, including DrawBDL, TSe+Mat and TSE+Glz, and xEsoView are also available. More than eight user interfaces that create and run EnergyPlus input files and display results graphically are available
(Demand Response Quick Assessment Tool, DesignBuilder, Easy EnergyPlus, EFEN, AECOSim, Hevacomp, and HLCP) and under development (TREATPlus and EPlusInterface). Software tools that were specifically designed to create
EnergyPlus input files or run parametric simulations include Easy EnergyPlus, ECOTECT, EnergyPlugged, EP Geo, EP Sys, EP-Quick, IFCtoIDF, ESP-r, Green Building Studio, and jEPlus.</p>
<p><i>EnergyPlus Example File Generator:</i> A Web-based service is available that creates and runs EnergyPlus input files for simple models of commercial buildings. The input files (and annual
results summary files) are sent to your e-mail address as attachments. This is a pilot project and is currently made available only as a BETA service. You can access the service and customize the
characteristics of the building you want to model on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/index.cfm">EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application</a></p>
<p><i>OpenStudio Plugin for Google SketchUp:</i> The <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/openstudio.cfm">OpenStudio Plugin</a> is a free plugin for the Google
SketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin makes it easy to create and edit the building geometry in your EnergyPlus input files. The plugin also allows you to launch EnergyPlus simulations and view the
results without leaving SketchUp.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_addons.cfm">EnergyPlus Add-ons</a> for more information on tools available for EnergyPlus, including some fetatures that are too big to include in the install.</p>
<h3>What's going on in V7.2?</h3>
<p><i>Will there be any considerable difference between version 7.1 and 7.2?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Yes.... and no.&nbsp; The basic structure of EnergyPlus is
still as it has been but there are some significant changes that you will want
to be aware of:</p>
<p>As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes. The highlights of features for this version are listed below&mdash;see <a href=
"http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_features.cfm">EnergyPlus Features Page</a> for a complete list of new features added in
this and previous versions:</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>There are a few key changes in the V7.2 IDD. For best
results, use the transition program to transfer from the earlier V7.1 files. Read the section on Multiple Version Conversion upgrades for some information on transitioning from earlier versions than V7.1 to the current version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Is version 7.2 backward compatible? Can I run v7.1 file in v7.2?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>There are several changes in the object structures. You can
also view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed
version.  This file has detailed explanations of changes to the objects.  There
is also the “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact object
changes that you can do by hand – for best results, the included conversion (utility IDFVersionUpdater)
program can be used.  The updater program is described more fully in the
Auxiliary Programs document. The next section describes how to get the set of programs for multiple version conversions.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, as happens in every EnergyPlus release, there are new checks on user input. Even if your file ran in an earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on validity of input.</p>
</blockquote>		  
<h3>Multiple Version Conversions</h3>
<p>Transition programs enable you to convert an IDF in one version to the next higher version. A set of programs (and associated files) has been written to 
enable a transition for multiple release versions. Downloading of the files is available from the add-ons page under  <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_addons.cfm">Additional Release Components</a>.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The documentation package included with EnergyPlus addresses all aspects of using EnergyPlus from user input to output examples to outside developer (module and interface) to internal programming
standards. It has been fully updated with this release. Though documentation is tagged as an optional component of the EnergyPlus install, it is a very important part
of EnergyPlus.<br>
Documents open with bookmarks and pages (PDF option) and open at the first page of text (rather than table of contents). The documents have embedded "named destinations" to facilitate direct access to topics.&nbsp;<br>

<p><i><b>EnergyPlus Documentation is searchable!</b></i> Using the indexing capabilities of Acrobat along with the search button on the main menu document, you can literally enter in a word and find all the occurrences of that word within the  pages of EnergyPlus documents. <b><span style='color:red'>(The search file capability was built in version X.&nbsp; There may be some
issues with using either version 7 or version 8 &ndash; we have tested in both versions and searches seem to be okay).&nbsp</span></b></p>
<p>There are some other documents of interest available on the web site including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and Validation Reports: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_testing.cfm">EnergyPlus Testing and Validation Reports
</a></li>
<li>Papers and Articles: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_research.cfm">EnergyPlus Research Papers and Articles</a></li>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weather Data</h3>
<p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder. EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations.&nbsp; The Weather
Converter program that is part of EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics reports about the included (or other) files.&nbsp;
<b>Weather data</b> for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be downloaded on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm">DOE EnergyPlus web site
weather data page</a>.</p>

<h2>Known problems</h2>
<p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the &ldquo;defects&rdquo; that have occurred during our testing, quite a few known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the
remaining known problems can be found in <a href="Known_Issues-V7-2-0.html">Known_Issues-V7-2-0.html</a>. If you are super interested in what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are
installed in the main EnergyPlus folder &ndash; html file <a href="Addressed_Issues-V7-2-0.html">Addressed_Issues-V7-2-0.html</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes known issues are too large or complicated to be
addressed in a simple change. These then get moved to our enhancment list and
addressed as priorities and funds allow.  To that end, we are including the
current (but not complete) enhancement list items.  (Not complete – because we
have many identified enhancements that didn’t originate from user problems).
Again, found in the main EnergyPlus folder – html file <a

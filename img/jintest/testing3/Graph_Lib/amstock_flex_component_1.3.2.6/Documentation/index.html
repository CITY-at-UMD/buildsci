    <p>AmLegend Class no longer extends Canvas, it extends UIComponent instead. This means that AmLegend doesn't support styles/properties/methods specific to Canvas anymore. It still has styles backgroundColor, backgroundAlpha, borderColor and borderAlpha. This change might cause error on your application if you used Canvas specific styles or properties. If you need them anyway, you can always put our legend into Canvas container.</p>
